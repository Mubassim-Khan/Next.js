We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be build once and serverd by CDN, which makes it much faster than aving a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generatin for many types of pages, including: 

- Marketing pages
- Blog post
- E-commerce product listing
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.
